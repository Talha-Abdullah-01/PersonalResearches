            <b>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</b>
          </p>
          <p>The concept of any device, to any content, in anyway is a major global trend that requires significant changes to the way devices are used. This trend is known as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>BYOD is about end users having the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business or campus network. With the growth of consumer devices, and the related drop in cost, employees and students can be expected to have some of the most advanced computing and networking tools for personal use. These personal tools include laptops, netbooks, tablets, smartphones, and e-readers. These can be devices purchased by the company or school, purchased by the individual, or both. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>BYOD means any device, with any ownership, used anywhere. For example, in the past, a student who needed to access the campus network or the Internet had to use one of the schoolâ€™s computers. These devices were typically limited and seen as tools only for work done in the classroom or in the library. Extended connectivity through mobile and remote access to the campus network gives students tremendous flexibility and more learning opportunities for the student. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>BYOD is an influential trend that has or will touch every IT organization. </p>
