          <p>The majority of businesses are small businesses. It is not surprising then that the majority of networks are small networks. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With small networks, the design of the network is usually simple. The number and type of devices on the network are significantly reduced compared to that of a larger network. The network topologies for small networks typically involve a single router and one or more switches. Small networks may also have wireless access points (possibly built into the router) and IP phones. As for connection to the Internet, normally a small network has a single WAN connection provided by DSL, cable, or an Ethernet connection. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Managing a small network requires many of the same skills as those required for managing a larger one. The majority of work is focused on maintenance and troubleshooting of existing equipment, as well as securing devices and information on the network.  The management of a small network is either done by an employee of the company or a person contracted by the company, depending on the size of the business and the type of business.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A typical small-business network is shown in the figure. </p>
