A project can be built using multiple programming languages, 
where each source file contains code in only one programming language. 
For example, with the Intel Fortran compiler installed in the Visual 
Studio IDE, we could write some source files in C and some in Fortran. 
Once all the source files are compiled into object files, the linker glues 
them together, along with any required libraries. 
As another example, we might write the user interface portion of your 
program in C#, and a library of high-performance 
functions in C, and have the C# code call into your C library.
