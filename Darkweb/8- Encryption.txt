Manual encryption is important as well- so hackers find it difficult to decrypt

* Symmetric and asymmetric encryption 

PGP - Pretty good Encryption
* very strong public key encryption
* unbroken
* Encrypt emails, text or files
* Sign message or files to verify integrity

* Symmetric encryption - Same key used by two users to decrypt the data ( known as secret key) - problem as key still has to be shared

* Asymmetric encryption- Different keys are used to decrypt the data. one for encrypt and other gonna decrypt
John makes a public key and private key . public key is shared with other user and private key can be used to decrypt as soon as john sends encrypted data

* Generating PGP key pairs:

clipboard icon or Applications- utilities and passwords and keys => GnuPG keys
Press + icon => PGP key => fake name/pvt email
advanced type => encryption type - RSA (strongest) , key strength (4096)
this will create a new pair of key
click left click, on properties

*Importing/Exporting keys:
Exporting public key (never share private key)
File on top -> export -> Tor browser directory, can use Armored PGP keys

once get public key 
Files on top->import -> select the public key 
use text editor and type the secret message , copy the message , clipboard icon -> sign/encrypt
choose the pair key and there will be a paste which is the encrypted data

once get the encrypted data -> clipboard will have something, click clipboard icon->decrypt


* Digital signatures - 
Sender encrypts messages with recievers public key AND signs message with own private key
Receiver verifies signature with sender's public key AND decrypts message with own private key

* Signing messages and encrypt
Text editor - type secret message - copy paste and clipboard icon and sign/encrypt, choose the one and sign message 
Reciever got -> clipboard icon-> decrypt and enter ur own password

* Encrypting and decrypting files
Need to send an image (after clearing meta data) .. right click=> encrypt and tick the user, can sign as well
once image is recieved, right click image -> open with decrypt file 

*Using key servers - server contains a number of keys -> anyone can upload his key
Download other users key from server

Go to clipboard icon - > edit ->preferences -> publish keys to -> server (onion)
then Remote->Sync and publish key -> sync ->uploaded on the key server

Other user-> find remote keys -> search for keys containing ->email/name
