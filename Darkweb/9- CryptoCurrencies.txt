* 4 ways to anonymously get bitcoin=>
1) Create bitcoins urself -> mine bitcoins
2) using an exchange+Tumbler/mixer -> complicated, not very anonymous
3) bitcoin ATMs ( check if ur coinatmradar.com and check if ATM is available in ur country)
4) Peer-to-Peer (with cash)

*Using bitcoin ATM's
=> Legacy address -> new account -> similar just choose legacy instead of segwit
legacy address -> starts wid 1 and segwit -> starts wid b
=> bank bitcoin and add to bitcoin wallet

* Using peer to peer
interact directly with seller, ID may be required
=>Potentially anonymous
* Local bitcoins and paxful are better => on bitcoin official site
Paxful -> 
More anonymous
Need to make new acc on paxful=> wont ask for much identity

send coins to server/service -> to a wallet
Mixers hide sources of funds
Examples
Bitcoin laundry(instant service), anonymous Bitcoin mixer, premium bitcoin mixer(expensive)
