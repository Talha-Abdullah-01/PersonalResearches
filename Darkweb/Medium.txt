Always encrypted data.. only at the start/end is decrypted
TOR Hidden services- TOR services are smartly built and cannot be found even server cannot find yours
Hacker can only see if im using TOR

TOR Problems:
Internet drops, Difficult to prevent leaks, web browser can also leak info, Data leaves un-encrypted
